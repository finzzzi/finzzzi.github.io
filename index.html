    <p>
        Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and 
        published by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), 
        which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. 
        Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team 
        occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. 
        Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", such as:
        
        <ul>
            <li>Crystal Maiden,</li>
            <li>Axe,</li>
            <li>and Invoker</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. 
        During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes 
        to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. 
        A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", 
        a large structure located within their base.
